    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a classic Indian dish of chicken cooked in a rich, creamy, and mildly spiced tomato-based gravy. 
        It's one of the most popular Indian curries around the world, known for its vibrant orange color and buttery flavor.</p>
    <p>The chicken is typically marinated in yogurt and spices, grilled or pan-fried, then simmered in a luscious sauce made with butter, cream, tomatoes, and aromatic spices. 
        Best served with naan or basmati rice, it's a crowd-pleaser that balances savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors.</p>
