    <h2>Desrciption</h2>

    <p>Shahi Paneer is a rich and creamy North Indian curry made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) 
        cooked in a thick gravy of cream, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of aromatic spices. 
        The term “Shahi” means “royal,” reflecting the dish's Mughlai roots and luxurious texture, 
        often enhanced with cashew or almond paste. It is known for its mildly sweet and spicy flavor, 
        smooth consistency, and a vibrant golden-yellow color due to turmeric and saffron.</p>

    <p>Typically served with naan, roti, or rice, Shahi Paneer is a popular choice at Indian restaurants and 
        festive meals. The paneer cubes absorb the rich gravy, making each bite flavorful and indulgent. 
        The dish is often garnished with fresh cream or coriander leaves, and while it's vegetarian, 
        it’s hearty and satisfying enough to be a main course.</p>
